# Project Name
Crushing Bugs  

## Project description
In this project I work on getting rid of bugs inside the Drag and Drop Puzzle. There are two bugs. Firstly, it will allow you to drop more than one puzzle piece in a drop zone, and secondly the puzzle pieces stay in their spot inside the drop zones even when the puzzle background is changed.
